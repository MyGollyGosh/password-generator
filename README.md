No fancy readme here.

Just some thoughts. Fun little activity done over the course of an hour. 
Wanted to make sure it was test driven development which had some interesting insights and forced me to think about the project before writing any logic.

Biggest limitation is the way that it is generated causes a loop of the same 3 kinds of digits in a row which makes it less secure. Would add in logic to add the different kinds of digits randomly throughout.
